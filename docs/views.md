# Views

Regenerator 2000 offers several specialized views to efficiently analyze and reverse engineer your C64 binaries.

## Disassembly View

The Disassembly View is the central workspace of Regenerator 2000. It shows the disassembled code, data, and text, offering a comprehensive interface for reverse engineering.

In this view, you can:

- **Navigate Memory**: Move through the address space, jump to specific addresses or labels, and follow code execution flows.
- **Define Block Types**: Classify memory regions as Code, Byte data, Word data, or various Text formats to make sense of the binary.
- **Annotate**: Add comments to lines or specific instructions and rename labels to something meaningful.
- **Analyze Flow**: Visual indicators show jump and branch targets, helping you understand the program's logic.

The Disassembly view consists of:

- **a**: The line number, in decimal. Each line has its own unique number.
- **b**: The arrows, that indicate code flow.
- **c**: The address, in hexadecimal.
- **d**: The bytes, in hexadecimal.
- **e**: A possible label, which has different prefix (see below).
- **f**: The mnemonic. E.g. `lda`
- **g**: The operand. E.g.: `#$05`
- **h**: A side comment. E.g.: `; this is a comment`

The autogenerated labels could have one of the following prefix:

- `j`: indicating that the label is a jump target (`jmp jC000`).
- `b`: indicating that the label is a branch target (`bne bC000`, `bmi bC000`, etc.).
- `s`: indicating that the label is a subroutine target (`jsr sC000`).
- `f`: indicating that the label is a field address (`lda fC000,x`).
- `a`: indicating that the label is a absolute address (`lda aC000`).
- `p`: indicating that the label is a pointer address (`lda (pA0, x)`).
- `e`: indicating that the label is an external address (`jmp eEA31`). External means an address outside the current file.

## Blocks View

The Blocks View visualizes the memory layout of your project as a contiguous map. It helps you quickly identify:

- **Code regions** (Blue)
- **Data regions** (Green/Yellow)
- **Undefined/Unknown regions** (Grey)

This bird's-eye view is essential for understanding the overall structure of the binary, finding gaps, and spotting large chunks of unanalyzed data. You can click on any block to jump to that location in the Disassembly View.

| **Toggle Collapsed Block** | ++ctrl+k++ |

## Hexdump View

The Hexdump View provides a raw hexadecimal representation of the memory, side-by-side with an text representation. It is useful for inspecting data that hasn't been formatted yet or for verifying the exact byte values in a region.

This view supports different text decoding modes to help you spot strings in standard C64 formats. It also shows the entropy of the data, which can help you identify regions that are likely to contain compressed data.

![Hexdump View](regenerator2000_hexdump_screenshot.png)

The Hex Dump view consists of:

- **a**: The address
- **b**: 16 byes of hex dump
- **c**: The text representation, that can be any of: "Screencode shifted", "Screencode unshifted", "PETSCII shifted", "PETSCII unshifted".
- **d**: The entropy of the data. The higher the value, the more randon it is.

![Hexdump Only](regenerator2000_hexdump_only.png)

The entropy is represented by these characters:

- ` ` (Empty) for Low Entropy (< 2.0)
- `░` (Light shade) for Moderate Entropy (< 4.0)
- `▒` (Medium shade) for Mixed Entropy (< 6.0)
- `▓` (Dark shade) for High Entropy (< 7.5)
- `█` (Full block) for Very High Entropy (> 7.5)

And entropy is calculated in 1024-bytes blocks. So the character shown is the entropy of the previous 512 bytes starting at the address of the row, plus the following 512 bytes.

## Sprites View

The Sprites View helps you find and analyze sprite data (hardware sprites).

- **64-byte Chunks**: Displays memory formatted as C64 sprites (24x21 pixels).
- **Multicolor Support**: Toggle multicolor mode to correctly view game characters and objects.
- **Identification**: Helps identifying player characters, enemies, and other game objects hidden in the binary.

## Charset View

The Charset View allows you to inspect memory as if it were a C64 character set (font). This is crucial for verifying if a memory region contains custom fonts.

- **Standard & Multicolor**: Toggle between standard hi-res characters and multicolor mode to see if the data makes sense as graphics.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Useful for spotting graphical data masquerading as code or raw bytes.

## Bitmap View

The Bitmap View renders memory as a bitmap image, allowing you to visualize large areas of memory as graphics.

- **Asset Discovery**: Useful for finding splash screens, background graphics, or loading screens.
- **Format Identification**: Can help identify the format of unknown large data blocks by visualizing patterns.
- **Screen RAM Overlay**: You can cycle through different Screen RAM addresses to see how colors apply to the bitmap data.

![Bitmap View](regenerator2000_bitmap_screenshot.png)

!!! warning

    The Bitmap View is heavy on the CPU. It is recommended to hide it once you stop using it.

The Bitmap View consists of:

- **a**: Bitmap mode (Multicolor or High-des) and how the bitmap is being rendered (HalBlocks, iTerm2)
- **b**: The bitmap and screen RAM addresses. For multi-color mode, the Color RAM is fixed.
- **c**: The bitmap itself
- **d**: Screen RAM cycle indicator

## Debugger View

The Debugger View integrates with the [VICE](https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/) emulator to provide live debugging capabilities without leaving Regenerator 2000.

Toggle the Debugger View with ++alt+6++ (or ++ctrl+6++). Once connected to VICE, the panel shows:

- **Connection status**: Whether Regenerator 2000 is connected to VICE and whether the emulator is running or stopped.
- **Live disassembly**: When the emulator is stopped, a small window of disassembly around the current PC, with the current instruction highlighted.
- **Registers**: A, X, Y, SP, and P (status) when available.
- **Breakpoints**: List of breakpoints set in VICE.
- **Watchpoints**: List of watchpoints set in VICE.

![Debugger View](regenerator2000_debugger_screenshot.png)

![Debugger Only](regenerator2000_debugger_screenshot_only.png)

The main **Disassembly** view also reflects the debugger state when connected: the current PC is highlighted, and breakpoints are indicated.

For more details on connecting to VICE and using the debugger, see [Debugger (VICE Integration)](debugger.md).
